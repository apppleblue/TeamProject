known bugs

	xpos and ypos dont update on dragend, only on transform/rotate.

	height and width not displayed for dev purposes.
	
	boundBoxfunction is inappropriate for setting transformer in current hard value form, if decimal bug comes
	back through testing then max values can be set to canvas size as quick fix.
	
	side bar should be smaller with tabulation the side instead of the top
